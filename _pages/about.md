Hi there! I'm Yoorhim Cho. I aspire to be a researcher specializing in the development of technologies that facilitate the coexistence of humans and artificial intelligence in society. Currently, I am working as a Student Intern (Assistant Researcher) at [ETRI](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri), and advisor at [Aerosol & Colloid Lab](https://youngsoojoung.wixsite.com/aerosol). My passion lies in the field of computer vision, with a particular focus on generative AI.
