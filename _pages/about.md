Hi there! I'm Yoorhim Cho. I believe that artificial intelligence can coexist with humans, and I'm interested in how it understands the world (especially in a three-dimensional world). My research interests include multimodal learning, 3D vision, and efficient learning. Currently, I'm a M.S. student at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do), where I'm advised by Prof. [Sungeun Hong](https://www.csehong.com/) in the Artificial and Medial Lab ([AIM Lab](https://aim.skku.edu/home)).
